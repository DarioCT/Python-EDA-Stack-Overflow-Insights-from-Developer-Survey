# Stack-Overflow-Insights-from-Developer-Survey
A short analysis of the most common tools used by the developers

The aim of this analysis will be to check what tools are the developers using these days be it in the realm of languages, databases, platforms or web frameworks. The comparison will be made between the tools they already use and the tools they would like to learn/use next year.

The main questions we are trying to answer are the following:

1. What Programming, Scripting, and Markup Languages are the most popular?
2. What Databases are the most popular?
3. What Platforms are the most popular?
4. What Web Frameworks are the most popular?

All of the code for this analysis is in the Jupyter Notebook named Insights from Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results 2019.ipynb

Libraries needed to run the code are:
  numpy
  pandas
  seaborn
